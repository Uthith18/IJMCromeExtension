## What the Extension Does

* **Scans each domain you visit** against a curated list of brands with known links to forced or child labor.  
* **Shows a simple popup alert**—no ads, no tracking—just a short message, the IJM logo, and a button to view ethical alternatives.  
* **Educates, not shames.** The goal is to raise awareness and give you actionable, ethical choices—not block your browsing or collect data.
